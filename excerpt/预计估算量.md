## Numbers Miscellaneous

This group of numbers is from a presentation Jeff Dean gave at a Engineering All-Hands Meeting at Google.

- L1 cache reference 0.5 ns
- Branch mispredict 5 ns
- L2 cache reference 7 ns
- Mutex lock/unlock 100 ns
- Main memory reference 100 ns
- Compress 1K bytes with Zippy 10,000 ns
- Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network 20,000 ns
- Read 1 MB sequentially from memory 250,000 ns
- Round trip within same datacenter 500,000 ns
- Disk seek 10,000,000 ns
- Read 1 MB sequentially from network 10,000,000 ns
- Read 1 MB sequentially from disk 30,000,000 ns
- Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA 150,000,000 ns

## The Lessons

- Writes are 40 times more expensive than reads.
- Global shared data is expensive. This is a fundamental limitation of distributed systems. The lock contention in shared heavily written objects kills performance as transactions become serialized and slow.
- Architect for scaling writes.
- Optimize for low write contention.
- Optimize wide. Make writes as parallel as you can.

## 参考指标
